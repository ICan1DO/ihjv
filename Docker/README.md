### Description

The docker hub image file has been deleted, so I decided to make this [repository](https://github.com/YamTian/Notes) public.

Unfortunately, using this method to deploy Docker is no longer valid.

### Server Configuration

1. Server: [Alibaba Cloud Elastic Computer Service](https://www.aliyun.com/product/swas)

2. Mirror system: CentOS 7.6

3. SSH Tool: [FinalShell](http://www.hostbuf.com/t/988.html)
